# Tailwind CSS standalone CLI bundled with DaisyUI

Repackaged [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) [standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli) that comes bundled with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - the most popular component library for Tailwind CSS.

This repository employs [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/dobicinaitis/tailwind-cli-extra/actions) to generate patched versions of the upstream CLI tool whenever a new version of Tailwind CSS or daisyUI is released.
